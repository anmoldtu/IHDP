# IHDP

This is the implementation of the IHDP method proposed in the Research Paper "Application of Transfer Learning for Defect Prediction on Datasets with Heterogeneous Metrics"

## Submission
Submitted to the Journal - [Information and Software Technology](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-software-technology).

## Running the Script and Generating the Results
Start the script `sample.py`. All the dataset file names should be specified in the variable specified here. (The group of datasets containing the same metrics should be put in the same list). The script can then be run and the results will be generated in `Results.xlsx`. The result file contains three performance measures - PD (True Positive Rate), PF (False Positive rate) and AUC (Area under the ROC curve). 

## Datasets
Emperically collected Android Dataset Will be released in further versions.
